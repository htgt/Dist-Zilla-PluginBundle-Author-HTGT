        Remove Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PerlTidy dependency.

0.009     2012-05-01 16:01:57 Europe/London

        Disable Perl::Critic RequireUseStrict and RequireUseWarnings
        checks around the generated version-setting code, as this code
        may be inserted before strict/warnings are enabled.

        Drop Test::EOL.

0.008     2012-05-01 13:40:42 Europe/London

        Add Dist::Zilla::Plugin::HTGTPkgVersion. This is identical to
        the standard Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PkgVersion only it indents
        the added code 4 characters for consistency with the HTGT
        PerlTidy conifguration.

0.007     2012-05-01 12:47:44 Europe/London

        Add Perl::Critic and EOL tests. Perl::Critic is configured to
        test package names, so drop PackageNameTests from our author
        bundle.

0.006     2012-04-25 09:36:11 Europe/London
	Bugfix Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PackageNameTests::munge_file(). 
	The release tests are renamed from xt/ to t/ before munge_file() is called,
	so updated filename in filter appropriately.

        Install the package names tests in xt/release.

        Bugfix Dist::Zilla::Plugin::PackageNameTests - the -f test in
        File::Find::find() was looking for the full path, failing to
        take account of the chdir done by File::Find.
